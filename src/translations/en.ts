    summary2: `My name is Kristina and I am described as a determined, self-motivated, and ambitious developer by my peers.
I have several hobbies that keep me busy while I'm not programming, these include: making music and playing video games.
I'm always looking for new passions and hobbies to explore and learn about. I am currently completing my education in an American University where I specialize in Computer Science, while residing in Georgia.
A great piece of software is never finished, it is only improved upon continually. Coding is an art form and a science all at once.
I strive to take any project I work on to new heights, striving to create the most useful and well executed solutions I can.`,
